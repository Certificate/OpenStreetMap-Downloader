# OpenStreetMap-Downloader
Loads a level 13-zoom map from OSM between the 2 given coordinate pairs. Input 4 float values one at a time: 1st latitude, 1st longitude, 2nd latitude and 2nd longitude.

After the script finishes, it will openb the generated picture in a pop up window (on my Mac at least...). Option to save the file at the very end of the code (currently commented away).
